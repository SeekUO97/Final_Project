  <h3> ‚úÖ Complete Pre-Ride Checklist </h3>
  <ol>
 
    <li><strong>Mount Your Motorcycle:</strong><br>
	‚Ä¢ Approach from the left side of the motorcycle.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Hold the clutch lever fully with your left hand.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Swing your right leg over the bike and sit comfortably.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Place both feet firmly on the ground to stabilize yourself.<br>
	
	<br>
	</li>
    <li><strong>Starting the Engine:</strong><br>
	‚Ä¢ Insert the key into the ignition and turn it to the <i>"ON"</i> position.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Check which gear the bike is in; if it is not in neutral, shift the bike into neutral.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Switch the killswitch to the <i>"RUN"</i> position.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Press the starter button to start the engine.<br>

	<br>
	</li>

    <li><strong>Engaging the Clutch and Shifting into First Gear:</strong><br>
	‚Ä¢ Pull the clutch lever fully with your left hand to disengage the engine from the transmission.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Use your left foot to gently press the gear shift lever down into 1st gear<br>
	‚Ä¢ Ensure the clutch is fully pulled before shifting to avoid excessive wear and tear.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Keep the motorcycle balanced and steady while shifting gears.<br>
	<strong><b>‚ö†Ô∏è Shift only when it is safe to do so ‚ö†Ô∏è</b></strong><br>
	
	
	
	
	<br>
	</li>
	
    <li><strong>Preparing to move:</strong><br> 
	‚Ä¢ Make sure your right foot is off of the rear brake pedal.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Keep your right hand firmly holding the front brake lever if needed,<br>
	&nbsp; such as when starting on a hill or slope, to prevent the bike from rolling backward.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Be ready to simultaneously release the front brake with your right<br>
	&nbsp; hand and begin engaging the clutch with your left hand.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Stay balanced and maintain full control of the bike as you prepare to move forward. <br>
	<br>
	</li>
	
	
    <li><strong>Ready.. Set.. Go!</strong><br>
	‚Ä¢Slowly release the clutch lever with your left hand until you reach the <b> friction zone. </b> <br>
	&nbsp; <i>‚ö†Ô∏è This is where the bike will begin to pull forward. </i><br>
	‚Ä¢ As the clutch engages, <b> gradually </b> roll on a small amount of throttle (<i>if needed</i>) to maintain engine stability.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Continue releasing the clutch smoothly to allow the bike to move in a controlled manner. <br>
	‚Ä¢ Keep your eyes forward, maintain your balance on the bike, and steer smoothly as you begin your ride. <br>
	<b>üí° Tip: </b><i> Try to avoid jerky movements, smooth clutch and throttle control ensure a safer and more stable ride.</i> <br>
	
	
	
	<br>
	</li>
	
    <li><strong>Maintaining Speed and Control: </strong><br>
	‚Ä¢ Once the bike is moving, maintain a consistent speed using light, controlled throttle.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Keep your body relaxed and ensure your grip on the handlebars is firm but not tense. <br>
	‚Ä¢ Scan the road ahead and stay aware of your surroundings.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Keep your feet on the foot pegs and your eyes looking where you want to go <br>
	<b>üí° Tip: </b><i> Avoid excessively blipping the throttle and slamming on your brakes. </i><br>
	
	
	
	<br>
	</li>
	
    <li><strong>Smooth and Controlled Shifting:</strong><br>
	‚Ä¢ As your speed increases or decreases and engine RPM rises and falls, prepare to shift accordingly. <br>
	‚Ä¢ Fully disengage the clutch by pulling in the clutch lever with your left hand. <br>
	‚Ä¢ Gradually roll off the throttle.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Use your left foot to shift the gear shift lever, lift it up to upshift or down to downshift.<br>
	‚Ä¢ Release the clutch smoothly while gradually rolling back on the throttle to maintain power and balance. <br>
	‚Ä¢ Avoid abrupt gear changes to reduce wear on the transmission and clutch. <br>
	‚Ä¢ Maintain a relaxed posture and scan ahead for potential hazards during the shift. <br>
	
	
	
	<br>
	</li>
	
    <li><strong>Executing Safe and Controlled Turns:</strong><br>
	1. Slow down before the turn by gradually rolling off the throttle.<br>
	2. Apply brakes gently as needed, using approximately<b><i> 70% front brake and 30% rear brake pressure, </i></b><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avoid braking during the turn itself.<br>
	3. As you are entering the turn, look through the turn and focus on your intended path, not directly in front of the bike.<br>
	4. Lean your body and the motorcycle smoothly into the turn, maintaining a steady throttle. <br>
	5. Keep a firm, relaxed grip on the handlebars and avoid sudden movements to maintain control.<br>
	6. As you exit the turn, gently accelerate to regain speed and stabilize the bike. <br>
	
	<br>
	</li>
	
    <li><strong>Wrapping it up!</strong><br>
	1. Gradually reduce your speed by rolling off the throttle and applying both brakes.<br>
	2. Come to a complete stop and shift the bike into neutral.<br>
	3. Deploy the kickstand firmly, ensure there is nothing underneath it, and confirm the bike is stable.<br>
	4. Turn the kill switch to the <i> OFF </i> position, and turn the ignition off and remove the key.<br>
	5. Carefully dismount the bike by swinging your right leg over the seat and stepping down on the left side of the motorcycle. <br>
	<br>
